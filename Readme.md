# Web portal project

# General Explanation and Stacks:

This project, which I'm currently workin on using
only HTML markup language and Boostrap for stylling, was requested by deputy principal of a school. I'll provide an explanation of my approach to this project.

To extract the form contact data, I'm using the JavaScript programming language and as backend language we'll using the Node.js programming language.

# Explanation of the project

# Index.html

in this file, comprises two distinct structures: the header and the menu. The header features the primary title, accompanied by its respective names and a menu that is currently in the process of development.

# Contact.html

In this file, I've used the Front-End Boostrap web development framework, for the styles the head and body, I made a contact form so that I can send the deputy director the message that the recipient wishes to write.

# Form.html

In this file, I created a form so that the user who has doubts can register in advance and be able
to send to doubts to the deputy director.

# Contact.js

In this file, I've used the JavaScript programming language to make the user entry and API call to make the query to the
backend that I'll soon do with the Node.js programming language.
